# Tyler's Super Successful Telco Churn Project

## Project Summary

### Project Objectives:
> - Deliver a Jupyter Notebook walkthrough (no more than 5 minutes) that gives a high level overview tof my project.
> - Document my planning, process (data aquisition, data preparation, data exploration, data visualizations, statistical testing, modeling, and model evaluation,) as well as all relevent findings and key takeaways from each step.
> - Develop modules (acquire.py, prepare.py, explore.py) to make this process repeatable.
> - Be prepared to answer follow-up questions about my methods, code, findings, model

### Business Goals:
> - Identify at least one key driver of churn in the Telco data set.
> - Build a Machine Learning classification model that outperforms the baseline model to accuractely predict customer churn.
> - Document my process so that it can be presented live, as well as read later like a report.

### Audience:
> - Codeup Data Science (Instructors, Support Staff, and Peers.)

### Deliverables:
> - Final Jupyter Notebook of my report.
> - Live presenation of Jupyter Notebook.
> - All modules required to replicate my project
> - .csv file that documents my predications along side actual values for Telco Churn.
> - All necessary Jupyter Notebooks to document each stage of the DS Pipeline.

### Project Context:
> - The Telco Churn data set came from the Codeup database.
> - 

### Data Dictionary:
> - Insert snazzy table here

### Initial Hypothoses:
> - Hypothosis 1 - 
> - ${H_0}$: 
> - $H_a$: 
> - Hypothosis 2 -
> - $H_0$:
> - $H_a$:
